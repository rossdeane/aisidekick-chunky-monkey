Car Hood FAQs Here is a collection of questions we are frequently asked… Can I buy online from you? We know just how many different types of car hood there are and just how easy it is to buy the wrong hood for your car so we prefer to have a chat with you about your requirements. However, we sell a selection of hoods on our eBay shop ‘carhoods1’ for the VW Golf MK1 & MK3, Saab 900 Classic, MGF & MGTF, Mazda MX5 MK1 & MK2, Honda S2000, Ford Escort MK3, 4 & 5, BMW Z3 and BMW E36. If you don’t know the exact style of hood that you need for your particular make, model, year and variation of car, then speak to one of our experts who can determine exactly the right hood for your car. Of course, you can browse the different types of hoods we offer, but to save you all the hassle that comes with buying the wrong hood, when you are ready to buy just give us a call on 020 8391 5324 / 5326 or send us an email with your contact number and requirements and we’ll do our very best to help. I have bought my car hood, will you fit it for me? Yes, but because you haven’t bought your hood from us, we cannot guarantee the finished fit of the hood. Because we constantly aim to deliver the best quality products and fitting service for our customers, we prefer to fit car hoods that we have supplied. This enables us to ensure that you only get the best quality product as well as the best fitting service, but if you have already bought your car hood, then just give us a quick call on 020 8391 5324 / 5326 to see if we can help. If you do buy your own car hood, make sure you deal with a well-established and reputable company, that will recommend a hood fitter to you if you decide not to fit it yourself. Do you fit the hoods that you supply? YES! Our purpose built premises in Sevenoaks, Kent, our mobile fitting service and our trusted network of approved car hood fitters across the UK, means that at Car Hood Warehouse we pride ourselves on providing the very best car hood fitting service in the country for all the hoods that we supply. What is included in your price? Our supply only prices do not include frames, seals, window frames and fixings or delivery charges.  We charge £15 including VAT for deliveries within mainland U.K. and prices vary for outside mainland UK. Our supply and fit prices do not include frames, seals or window frames. If you are unsure as to what you need just give us a call on 020 8391 5324 / 5326 or send us an email with your contact number and requirements and we’ll do our very best to help. How long will I have to wait for my car hood? As the nation’s largest car hood and soft top supplier we hold the largest stock of car hoods in the country. We also manufacture, supply and fit more hoods daily than any other company. In fact many of our competitors actually source their stock from us. This means that we will usually have your hood in stock and if we don’t then we order it in or manufacture your required hood so you usually won’t have to wait more than a week to 10 working days for your car hood to be ready for fitting. I want to save money, should I buy my hood on the Internet and then fit it myself? You will no doubt be aware of the availability of cheap replacement car hoods on the Internet. Our strong advice to you is NEVER purchase a hood from any company or individual who cannot fit the hood for you. Most sellers will not accept returns on car hoods once you have started to fit them. Based on all our experience it is our honest opinion that fitting hoods on most modern convertibles is not an easy do-it-yourself job. If you think you will save money and will be able to fit your own hood, then we advise you to think again! Do I have to come to your premises to have my new car hood fitted? NO! Our mobile car hood technicians can come to your house or place of work and fit your new car hood. We can fit the majority of car hoods on a mobile basis*. So if you require a hood for your Mazda MX5, Rover 214, MGF, Ford Escort, VW Golf, BMW 3 Series or Z3 or any other make please call us on 020 8391 5324 / 5326 or email us to discuss your requirements. *Subject to availability and Terms & Conditions Do you provide a guarantee? YES!! All our car hoods come with a 12 month guarantee so you can rest assured that IF there are any problems we will do our best to resolve them or replace your hood all under guarantee. Many of our hoods with glass windows for models such as the Honda S2000, Audi A4, Porsche 996, Toyota MR2, Porsche Boxster and BMW Mini are manufactured using a superior window bonding systems which come with a 3-year guarantee to eliminate window bond failure. Do you repair car hoods? No – sorry. Despite what you might read on the internet, we believe generally it is neither practical nor economical to repair car hoods. The average life of a car hood is anything between 5 to 10 years depending on how well they have been looked after. Any repairs that you do try to make could end up making the issue you have worse. How can I prolong the life of my new car hood? To prolong the life of you car hood, you should always store the car with the hood up, never leave your soft top down when it is wet, as mould and shrinkage will occur. Other maintenance tips include: Keep your new soft top in the CLOSED position for a minimum of two days to allow the material to stretch to the correct tension. NEVER use a jet wash/car wash to clean the soft top. NEVER store the soft top in the open position for long periods of time or when the soft top is wet. Avoid long periods of inactivity of the mechanism as this can cause the frame to seize. If you have a VINYL soft top – Clean with a soft damp cloth using diluted mild detergent such as washing up liquid. If you have a MOHAIR soft top – Clean with a soft clothes brush to remove the dust and use a damp cloth diluted mild detergent such as washing up liquid to remove stains. Do you have other questions?

In fact great value, you have transformed the car and I thoroughly recommend any TVR or soft top owner to use your expertise first. Robin – Happy customer with a TVR Google Rating 4.9 Based on 158 reviews Car Hood Warehouse 4.9 × Simon M 21:25 27 Feb 25 They did a great job of fitting a new roof on my daughter's VW Beetle – excellent service Jeremy Grover 19:35 04 Feb 25 Not Impressed.I had  a new soft top fitted to my 10 Yr old audi tt mk2.  I was v pleased with the result professional service  offered and although I had to pay a bit extra as hood was grey. Update so after about a year the inner lining started to come unstuck I took it all the way back from stansted essex left it with them for 2 days and they said it was just the velcro that needed pushing back on and they had fully tested it and put some extra adhesive on it. Two days later same problem again. Obviously there is a fault at least the adhesive they used stopped the lining from covering half the rear window  however they once again said I would have to travel back. Selling the car now but considering I paid £2,200 for this roof I'm not impressed but the customer service I was given. Where the lining had come unstuck it also made the finish on the inside rough and the rear window demister also stopped working. Audi do not use velcro fixings on their roofs for a very good reason .... Sue 19:12 29 Jan 25 I took my Audi A3 convertible to have the roof fixed as it was coming away from the rear window. I called carhood warehouse after calling several companies and at last was talking to people who knew what they were talking about. Due to the distance from my home they agreed for me to meet Nick on a Saturday morning and I felt confident that my pride and joy was being fixed by a professional company. Cost was exactly as quoted and the service, workmanship and work done was excellent. Would highly recommend sharon Hook 13:26 30 Nov 24 I can't recommend enough. From my initial call to dropping off my car...then picking it up. A smooth stress free service,. And my roof looks amazing.  Thank you car hood warehouse.

Mark Toynbee 15:08 23 Nov 23 Very happy with their service and product. New mohair hood fitted to my 2002 Mazda MX5 while I waited - less than three hours. I've now had it a couple of months. My car lives on the drive in all weathers. The hood doesn't leak, it's easier to put up and down than the old vinyl one and the car is quieter at speed - better fit and less wind noise. Recommended Michael Lay 17:23 18 Aug 23 Had a good quality mohair roof fitted to my Chrysler Crossfire today. In less than three hours, fantastic,  I would like to thank Tina and the guys for doing a great job. Would  recommend anyone to go there.  Thanks again.Regards,Michael lay. Gordon Lewis 14:44 23 Jul 23 Brilliant new moh paul johnston 14:07 30 Jun 23 Did the roof on my A124 and still in great condition. Claire Marshall 14:50 28 Jun 23 Omg how amazing is this company?I couldn't be happier with the service they provided, my glass had come away from my soft top on my audi a5I spoke to them in the afternoon and I was booked In for the next morning,  unfortunately I needed a new outer to my roof and they supplied and fitted a reconditioned part at half the price of a new one.Definitely recommend them if u need any help or advice with ur soft top. Tim Wright 14:51 29 May 23 I enquired of a number of soft top specialists before choosing Car Hood Warehouse to replace the hood on our much loved BMW Z3 2.8 and none were as confidence inspiring as these guys.From my first telephone enquiry, a subsequent visit to discuss the job, see fabric samples and check out colours to the final fitting they couldn't have been more welcoming or more professional.  They were happy to spend time discussing options and to explain what the job involved - it certainly convinced me not to attempt to fit a new hood myself!From placing an order to collecting the car I couldn't have asked for better service. It probably goes without saying that the new hood fits perfectly with no leaks or frame rattles - and in my opinion looks so much better than the original black hood.  Many thanks to Tina, Nick and Tyrone at Car Hood Warehouse. Darren Warburton 09:51 17 May 23 Very helpful,  knowledgeable  and friendly people,  top marks david harvey 11:49 30 Mar 23 Just had the roof and rear window replaced on my Alfa Romeo Spider by this company.

It was a real pleasure to deal with this company; they called when they said they would to confirm everything (as it was a 100 mile trip from home I was obviously anxious not to arrive and find a problem), were ready to start when I arrived, and the job was completed on time and at the cost quoted. Friendly and knowledgeable staff - such a pleasant surprise these days when that is becoming unusual - and the new hood looks great. I thoroughly recommend this company. Phil Taylor 15:34 10 Feb 22 I booked to have a new mohair roof for my Audi 80 convertible.  Due to COVID there was a little delay and coupled with the 150 mile each way journey I have to admit I was a little worried that the roof would be wrong.There was no need to worry, these guys know their stuff and it only took them 4 hours from start to finish. So pleased with the result and would thoroughly recommend them. Thanks to all at Car Hood Warehouse. David & Morna Limer 16:20 09 Feb 22 Great people to deal with and job done well within the time stated. Good quality roof supplied for my Mercedes CLK and  very well fitted. They also tidied up my headlining which had become loose. All in all a pleasurable experience and easy to access by train. John Farthing 21:54 12 Nov 21 I took my Mk 2 NB 10 Anniversary MX-5 in yesterday for a new replacement mohair hood as the original vinyl was failng and simply looked tatty. I have owned the car from new and am very precious about it, so was a little nervous about trusting her to another for such a significant alteration to its appearance.I really shouldn't have worried. The set up is small but very clean and efficient - this is no "back street" operation! The staff were very knowledgable, friendly and chatty (whilst observing the necessary social distances due to Corona requirements). After less than 3 hours, I returned to the warehouse to find my pocket-rocket resplendant in beautiful new blue mohair top that's far superior to the original fitted vinyl.If you live in the South East and are in the market for a new hood, Car Hood Warehouse is certainly the place to go. Simon Owen 11:39 05 Nov 21 Brilliant service. Took my MX5 in and work was completed quicker then advertised, great new hood, great service, great price. Would 100% use again. Can't recommend enough.

Excellent service and a fantastic product Teresa Chivers 16:31 27 Jan 16 we recently had my mazda mx5 hood replaced, and could not believe the professional and excellent service which we received, after travelling up from somerset for 3 hours we were met with a very friendly and informative gentleman after leaving our car for the morning we returned to a first class and stunning job, this company is first rate and will recommend to anyone looking to replace a car hood. It is nice to see there is still craftsmen and companies that do and say what exactly what they quote.  Excellent work.
